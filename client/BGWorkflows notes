Monitor User Bottles:
    Basically monitor user removable bottles, and raises the events below.
    
Monitor Haz Bottle
    EVENT_HAZ_WASTE_BOTTLE_REMOVED = 21880
    EVENT_HAZ_WASTE_BOTTLE_REPLACED = 21883
    EVENT_HAZ_WASTE_BOTTLE_FULL = 21887

Monitor Standard Bottle
    EVENT_STD_WASTE_BOTTLE_REMOVED = 21881
    EVENT_STD_WASTE_BOTTLE_REPLACED = 21884
    EVENT_STD_WASTE_BOTTLE_FULL = 21888

Monitor DI Bottles
    EVENT_DI_SUPPLY_BOTTLE_REMOVED = 21882
    EVENT_DI_SUPPLY_BOTTLE_REPLACED = 21885
    EVENT_DI_SUPPLY_BOTTLE_EMPTY = 21886

    if EVENT_DI_SUPPLY_BOTTLE_REMOVED then DI Transfer is disabled

Questions:
    haz_waste_bottle_full, std_waste_bottle_full, ext_di_bottle_empty seems to be set, but no one's using it.

BW Mix and Fill DI
    - Assess conditions every 1 second

    1. BW Mix

    2. DI Fill
        - If DI Bottle was removed, DI Fill will not be done
        - DI Fill will be done until pressure is achieved.
        
Waste Transfer

- Runs every second
    - First get the tank volumes
    - Checks are done
        (A) Bottle is not removed -> This is from Monitor User Bottles workflow signalling transfer waste
        (B) Door is not open
        (C) Scavenge Vacuum is not too high or low
        (D) External Bottle is not too high or Internal Bottle is not too low
    - If any of the above checks are true, just shut off the Valve
    - Otherwise, do the transfer if the volume if the internal tank reaches a threshold by turning on the valve
    - Other checks are done while transfer is happening:
        - After 20 sec of turning on the valve, BG workflow will:
            - Compare the new volume with the original volume above
           

- If ext tank difference is less than 80% of difference in difference in internal tanks, raise below alarm and turn off BG workflow
                - If we have done a successful transfer before => report leakage (21870)
                - if we have not done a successful transfer yet => report incorrect piping (21872)
            - If ext tank difference is less than 50ml, raise below alarm and turn off BG workflow
                - If we have done a successful transfer before => report inefficient (21871)
                - if we have not done a successful transfer yet => report incorrect piping (21872)
